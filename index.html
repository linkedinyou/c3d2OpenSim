<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>



<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li><a   href="https://code.google.com/p/b-tk/wiki/MatlabBinaries">Download btk-c3d matlab binaries</a> and put in yourMatlab path. </li>
  <li>Download zip of this project. Unzip folder and put in Matlab Path.
  <li>Type 'c3d2Opensim' in the matlab command window, If previous steps have been completed successfully, a selection window will appear and by selecting a c3d file, a marker file (.trc) and a ground reaction force file (.mot) will be created.
  <li>You can setup a batch script by sending it a path to a c3d file ie c3d2Opensim('C:\MoCapData\subject1_trial1.c3d').
  <li>If you have issues, please post to the issue section on Github</li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<pre><code>
c3d2Opensim( 'c3dFilePath','C:\path2c3dFile\example.c3d', ...
             'rotation', {'z' 90 'x' 90}, ...
             'filter', {'mrks' 'butt' 16 'grf' 'critt' 40},...
             'mrkList', {'LTH1' 'LTH2' 'RTH1' 'RTH2' 'RTH3'});
</code></pre>

<p>The below code block uses 'example2.c3d', rotates the data 90 degrees about X and filters the ground reaction forces with a butterworth filter at 40Hz. No marker filtering occurs and all markers are exported. </p>

<pre><code>
c3d2Opensim( 'c3dFilePath','C:\path2c3dFile\example2.c3d', ...
             'rotation', {'x' 90}, ...
             'filter', {'grf' 'butt' 40});
</code></pre>

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Limitations and known issues</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>This has only been tested on Force platforms of type 2. The outputs of the forceplate must be 3 forces (fx,fy,fz) and three moments (mx,my,mz). If you have unsupported force plates, please post a request.</li>
  <li>The c3d must have at least marker data in it. You don't need to have forces.
  <li>The string 'static' in the name of the c3d file will skip any force processing and just generate a .trc.
  <li>We don't process other types of analog data (EMG). This will be in a future release.</li>
</ul>

<p> The OpenSim team would like to acknowledge Thor Besier (U Ackland), Cyril Donnelly (U Western Australia) and Glen Litchwark (U Queensalnd) for their significant code contributions to this code. We would also like to acknowledge Arnaud Barre and Stephane Armand for their wonderful BTK (Biomechanical Toolkit) software, which is used for c3d reading. We are sure that we are not leveraging it as much as we could. Please support the btk project.</p>
